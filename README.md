                                 OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

OBJECTIVES

   To develop an interactive weather forecasting tool that allows users to select a city and display its current temperature.
   To enhance user experience with a visually appealing design, using elements like background color, shadow effects, and rounded borders.
   To provide real-time weather information for different cities, enabling users to make informed decisions based on the weather.
   To implement responsive web design techniques ensuring that the weather forecasting page functions well on various devices and screen sizes.
   To utilize JavaScript for dynamic content updates, such as displaying selected city temperatures interactively without refreshing the page.

 KEY ACTIVITIES

     1.Research and data collection: 
      
          Gather accurate weather data for various cities, either by using APIs or mock data for simulation purposes.
      
     2.Designing the user interface: 

          Create a visually appealing layout with CSS, ensuring the design is clean, intuitive, and user-friendly.

     3.Coding the interactive functionality: 
          
          Implement JavaScript functions to dynamically display selected city temperatures based on user interaction with the dropdown menu.

     4.Ensuring mobile responsiveness: 
     
          Adjust the layout and elements with CSS to ensure the weather forecasting tool looks and functions well on different devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, desktops).
     
     5.Testing and debugging:
     
          Test the functionality of the project across different browsers and devices, ensuring correct display and performance of weather data and interactive elements.
    
     6.Optimization for performance: 
     
          Optimize the code to ensure quick load times and smooth functionality, particularly for interactive features like temperature updates.
     
     7.User feedback and iteration: 
     
          Gather feedback from users on the usability of the tool and refine the interface and features accordingly.

     8.Documentation and presentation:
     
          Prepare detailed documentation of the code, design choices, and functionalities to support future development or handover.



TECHNOLOGIES USED

   1.HTML - Structure of the webpage, defining elements like headings, dropdown menus, and buttons.
    
   2.CSS -   Styling of the webpage, such as background colors, text formatting, margins, borders, and shadows for the interactive elements like dropdown menus and weather displays.

   3.JavaScript -   Client-side scripting for dynamic behavior, such as updating the temperature display when a user selects a city from the dropdown menu.
   
   4.Responsive Web Design -     Use of CSS to ensure that the webpage adjusts its layout and appearance for different devices, like mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
